# What is This?
- RE2 is an E-C-S based game engine.
- The name itself stands for a great purpose **"Rust-Everyday"**. "2" in RE2 is because it's 2D.
- I love Rust, I want Rust Everyday.
# Where are We?
- Currently, RE2 implemented an E-C-S data-driven module engine, a series of macros to make **"Script-Language-like"** scene creation, an Event system with dispatchers and event loop, and an Editable render process.
- However, when i tried to implement a parallel renderer in the name of con-corrency.I found Glium is, in other words, OpenGL is barely able to implement a parallel renderer.
# Currently Stopped Now
- I 've put myself into a great crate **"Vulkano-rs"** and deeply charmed by its funcitonal-language like vulkan wrapper. I am learning unsafe Rust "Rustonomicon" at the same time, and hope vulkano-rs has its best.

# An Update For Almost Two Years
- At the end of 2020, I resigned my job in Virtuos Gaming and became a traitor. In purchase of money, I went to Perfect World with almost 4 times of Virtuos' salary. It wouldn't be long for me to realize that I had made a MISTAKE. Perfect World's job was exhausting and I have little time for myself to do externl readings. What's even worse is that, Perfect World just moved into a newly built office building, and I was heavliy sentitive to air pollution. I got nor issues at that time and I can barely breathe or have a okay sleep.
- In the middle of 2021, I decided to resign my job again and become even more of a traitor. With my nose issues also a symbol of traitor, I knew it gonna be hard for me to find another satisfying job. I went directly back home and prepared for the post-graduate entrance examition. 

- Why i deleted re2 repo? Because while I was reading Vk, I got to know more about rendering, I felt RE2 is still so naive and needs lots of features to be called an "Engine".I did some learning in Vk, but still struggleing to finish Real-Time-Rendering. But while i was in Perfect World, I could barely have time for reading, neither coding for RE2.
- Why I re-upload RE2? Because I was in the interview of post-graduate entrance examition, and I need to show the mentors the evidence for doing this. Although it's naive from my perspective today, I still cares about it.

- This more that half a year has been one of the darkest days in my life. I wasn't working, neither wasn't I studying. I felt bad because my life stucked and couldn't move foward. I felt even worse when my nose issues made me hard to breathe. I felt guilty for bratying Virtuos and Perfect World.
- But as time goes by, it is becoming more and more clear to me. I just want to move. I just don't want to stand ground any more. If I don't move myself, my dream of being the one who can instantiate every imagination won't come true itself. I MUST MOVE ON. Whatever happens after the interview, whether I success or failed. whether continuing study or finding a new job. I want to MOVE ON. I still have the hope, it's still possible to finish the things undone. If you are still reading this, just wanna let you that I appercaite your trusts. 

Thanks, my friend.
