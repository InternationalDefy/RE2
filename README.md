# What is This?
- RE2 is an E-C-S based game engine.
- The name itself stands for a great purpose **"Rust-Everyday"**. "2" in RE2 is because it's 2D.
- I love Rust, I want Rust Everyday.
# Where are We?
- Currently, RE2 implemented an E-C-S data-driven module engine, a series of macros to make **"Script-Language-like"** scene creation, an Event system with dispatchers and event loop, and an Editable render process.
- However, when i tried to implement a parallel renderer in the name of con-corrency.I found Glium is, in other words, OpenGL is barely able to implement a parallel renderer.
# Currently Stopped Now
- I 've put myself into a great crate **"Vulkano-rs"** and deeply charmed by its funcitonal-language like vulkan wrapper. I am learning unsafe Rust "Rustonomicon" at the same time, and hope vulkano-rs has its best.
